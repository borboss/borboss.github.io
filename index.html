<h1>This is a website.</h1>
<h2>What for?</h2>
<p>I want to have a centralized place for all my projects. For now, you can find some on my <a href="borboss.itch.io">itch.io page</a>, and <a href="github.com/borboss">my github page</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to find me, I'm either @notborboss or @borboss on most social medias. My profile picture is usually an angry face.. but you should just be able to tell anyways.</p>
<p>I prefer you contact me through discord though, @borboss</p>
<h2>Why is it so empty?</h2>
<p>I will edit this... eventually...</p>
